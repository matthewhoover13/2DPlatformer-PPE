Created for a school project, this 2D platformer was made in Python using the Pygame library. It began as a simple Connect 3 project to learn Python and Pygame, then physics were slowly added throughout the semester with each project. First with Orbital Pac-Man using gravity, momentum, and simple collision between circles, then bocce and pinball for more types of semi-advanced collision, and finally a 2D platformer that I built off for the final project. The original platformer was one single level that fit on one screen, and the final product has several levels, camera movement, player upgrades, and more.
